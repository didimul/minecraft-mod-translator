Instruction 1:
    If you need a translation from English to Russian:
        - Upload the en_us.json file (open the mod's .jar file, I usually open it with 7z, then go to assets =) to the input folder.
            • Where to get en_us.json:
            1: Open the mod's .jar file (I usually open it with 7z)
            2: Go to assets => "mod name" => lang
            3: Get en_us.json
        - Open the start.bat file
        - Wait for the translation to complete (translate via Google Translate)
        - Open the output folder
        - Get the ru_ru.json file
        - Open the mod's .jar file
        - Go to assets => "mod name" => lang
        - Upload the ru_ru.json file to the lang folder.

Instruction 2:
    If you need a translation from another language to another:
        - Open the language.json file
        - Where it says "fromLang":
            1: Remove "en"
            2: Write "language to translate from" in double quotation marks
            !!! In short (ISO 639) format, for example, english = en or russian = ru

        - Where "toLang" is written:
            1: Remove "ru"
            2: Write "language to translate into" in double quotation marks
            !!! Also in short (ISO 639) format and must be in double quotes.

        - Where it says "inputFile":
            1: Remove "en_us.json"
            2: Write the language in short format, but slightly differently (example: ru (Russian) => ru_ru.json or de (Deutsch) => de_de.json)

        - Where it says "outputFile":
            1: Remove "ru_ru.json"
            2: Write the language in short format, but slightly differently (example: en (English (US)) => en_us.json or de (Deutsch) => de_de.json)

        - Then follow instruction 1.

        !!! The shortened language format for "inputFile" and "outputFile" can be found here: https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Language (possibly for "fromLang" and "toLang" as well, I I haven't checked)
