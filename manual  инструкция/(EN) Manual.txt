1 instruction:
 If you need a translation from English to Russian:
 - Drop the en_us.json file into the input folder
 - Open the start.bat file
 - Wait for the translation to complete (translation via Google Translate)
 - Open the output folder
 - Take the ru_ru.json file
 - Open the mod folder (.jar)
 - Go to assets => "mod name" => lang
 - Drop the ru_ru.json file into the lang folder

2 instructions:
 If you need a translation from another language to another:
 - Open the language.json file
 - Where it says "input": "Translation from which language" (in a short form, for example, english = en or russian = ru)
 - And where it says "to": "translation to the desired language" (also in a short form and always in double quotes)
 - Rename the file to the language to which the translation was made, for example, if from English to German, then file.json -> de_de.json
 - And then follow the 1st instruction

The abbreviated language format for file.json can be viewed here https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Language (possibly also for "input", I haven't checked)
